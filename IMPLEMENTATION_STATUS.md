## Technical Architecture Status

### Data Flow (Currently Functional):
```
WordPress Event Creation â†’ WP Webhooks â†’ n8n Cloud â†’ OpenAI APIs â†’ WordPress Update
```

### Workflow Nodes (n8n):
1. **Event Trigger** âœ… - Webhook receiving WordPress data
2. **Generate Theme** âœ… - ChatGPT creating event themes  
3. **Generate Image** âœ… - DALL-E creating banner images
4. **Upload Image** ðŸ”„ - WordPress media library integration (in progress)
5. **Update WordPress** ðŸ”„ - Saving AI content to event fields (pending image fix)

### WordPress Integration:
- **Custom Fields** âœ… - Structured event data storage
- **REST API** âœ… - n8n communication working
- **Mailchimp Forms** âœ… - Newsletter signup with event context
- **Event Display** ðŸ“‹ - Public event pages (pending theme integration)

## Testing & Validation Status

### Successful Tests âœ…:
- WordPress to n8n webhook communication
- OpenAI API integrations (both ChatGPT and DALL-E)
- WordPress REST API authentication  
- Custom post type creation and field management

### Current Debugging:
- Image binary data handling in n8n
- WordPress media upload via REST API
- Featured image assignment workflow

### Performance Metrics:
- **Automation Speed**: ~2-3 minutes for complete AI generation
- **Cost per Event**: ~$0.50-1.00 for AI content generation
- **Uptime**: 100% (DigitalOcean + n8n Cloud reliability)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI usage monitoring implemented
- **Webhook Reliability**: Error logging and manual fallback options planned
- **WordPress Security**: Regular updates and security hardening ongoing

### Business Risks:
- **Platform Policy Changes**: Self-hosted approach reduces dependency risk
- **Cost Scaling**: Free/low-cost tiers sufficient for Phase 1 volume
- **Community Acceptance**: Value-first approach prioritizes user benefit

## Success Criteria for Phase 1 Completion

### Core Functionality:
