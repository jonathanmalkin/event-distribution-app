# FetLife Integration Requirements - Community Platform

## 🎯 **Strategic Importance**

FetLife serves as the **trusted community platform** where specific venue details can be shared safely with the kink community, complementing the general public information posted on WordPress.

## 🔒 **Privacy-First Approach**

### **Two-Tier Information Strategy**
- **WordPress (Public)**: General location (neighborhood/area)
- **FetLife (Community)**: Specific venue details for trusted members

### **Content Differentiation**
```
WordPress Post:
"📍 Capitol Hill area, Seattle"
"RSVP for specific location details"

FetLife Event:
"📍 Analog Coffee, 235 Summit Ave E, Seattle, WA 98102"
"Direct venue information for community members"
```

## 🤖 **Technical Implementation Approach**

### **Web Automation (Puppeteer)**
Since FetLife doesn't provide a public API, we'll use browser automation:

- **Technology**: Puppeteer (headless Chrome)
- **Authentication**: Login automation with credentials
- **Event Creation**: Form filling and submission
- **Error Handling**: Screenshot capture for debugging
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful automation practices

### **FetLife Service Architecture**
```javascript
class FetLifeService {
  // Authentication
  async login(username, password)
  async logout()
  
  // Event Management  
  async createEvent(eventData)
  async updateEvent(eventId, updates)
  async deleteEvent(eventId)
  
  // Group Management
  async postToGroup(groupId, eventData)
  async getGroups()
  
  // Utilities
  async takeScreenshot(filename)
  async testConnection()
}
```

## 📋 **Event Creation Workflow**

### **FetLife Event Structure**
```javascript
{
  title: "Event Theme Name",
  description: "AI-generated description with full details",
  startDate: "2025-08-15",
  startTime: "19:00",
  endDate: "2025-08-15", 
  endTime: "21:00",
  location: {
    venue: "Analog Coffee",
    address: "235 Summit Ave E, Seattle, WA 98102",
    city: "Seattle",
    state: "WA"
  },
  eventType: "Public", // or "Private"
  category: "Social", // FetLife event categories
  groups: ["seattle-kinky-coffee", "pnw-kink"] // Auto-post to groups
}
```

### **Automation Steps**
1. **Login**: Authenticate with FetLife credentials
2. **Navigate**: Go to event creation page
3. **Fill Form**: Input event details with full location
4. **Upload Image**: Add AI-generated banner if supported
5. **Group Posting**: Cross-post to relevant groups
6. **Verification**: Confirm event was created successfully
7. **Cleanup**: Logout and close browser

## 🖼️ **Media Handling**

### **Image Strategy**
- **FetLife Limitations**: Limited image support in events
- **Workaround**: Include image URL in description if upload fails
- **Fallback**: Text-based event description with emoji formatting

### **Content Formatting**
```html
🌟 [Event Theme] 🌟

[AI-Generated Description]

📅 Date: [Full Date]
⏰ Time: [Start Time] - [End Time]
📍 Location: [Full Venue Address]

☕ Join us for coffee, conversation, and community!
💌 This is a public, social event welcoming all experience levels

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance**

### **Account Management**
- **Dedicated Account**: Separate FetLife account for automation
- **Credentials Storage**: Encrypted environment variables
- **Session Management**: Proper login/logout cycles
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful request timing

### **Community Guidelines**
- **Content Appropriateness**: Follow FetLife community standards
- **Spam Prevention**: Limit posting frequency
- **Group Etiquette**: Only post to relevant, appropriate groups
- **Privacy Respect**: Honor community privacy expectations

### **Error Handling**
- **CAPTCHA Detection**: Handle anti-bot measures gracefully
- **Login Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Form Changes**: Adapt to FetLife UI updates
- **Screenshot Logging**: Debug failed automations

## 🎯 **Group Management Strategy**

### **Target Groups**
- **Primary**: Seattle Kinky Coffee group (if exists)
- **Secondary**: Pacific Northwest kink communities
- **Tertiary**: General coffee/social groups in Seattle area

### **Posting Strategy**
- **Event Creation**: Always create as main event
- **Group Cross-posting**: Share to 2-3 relevant groups max
- **Scheduling**: Avoid consecutive posts to same groups
- **Engagement**: Monitor and respond to comments/questions

## 🔧 **Technical Requirements**

### **Dependencies**
```json
{
  "puppeteer": "^21.0.0",
  "puppeteer-extra": "^3.3.6",

FETLIFE_PASSWORD=secure_password_here
FETLIFE_HEADLESS=true
FETLIFE_SCREENSHOT_PATH=/tmp/fetlife-screenshots
FETLIFE_DEFAULT_GROUPS=seattle-kinky-coffee,pnw-kink
```

### **Browser Configuration**
- **Headless Mode**: Production runs without GUI
